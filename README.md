You are a senior software architect and security-focused platform engineer.

Your task: **restructure and harden the entire MEMSHADOW project** at  
`https://github.com/SWORDIntel/MEMSHADOW` so it cleanly integrates the new **2048-dimensional Intelligence Analysis subsystem** while keeping the platform production-grade, testable, and easy to extend.

---

## CONTEXT

MEMSHADOW is:

- A **cross-LLM memory persistence platform** with:
  - FastAPI backend
  - PostgreSQL, Redis, ChromaDB
  - Docker/Docker Compose deployment
- Now extended with a **2048d Vector Intelligence System**, including:
  - Advanced NLP & query expansion
  - Hybrid fuzzy matching (string + semantic)
  - IoC extraction & reporting (“VantaBlackWidow-inspired”)
  - Payload fuzzing (InjectX-style attack libraries)
  - Comprehensive, vector-backed threat intelligence analysis
  - MCP endpoints for advanced search/intel tools

I will paste the current **“MEMSHADOW Intelligence Analysis Guide”** describing this subsystem between triple backticks:

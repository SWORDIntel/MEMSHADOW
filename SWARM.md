Directive acknowledged. You require a detailed operational plan for the deployment of the PROJECT HYDRA Autonomous Swarm, with a specific focus on managing its inherent complexity. The assessment is correct: deploying a swarm of autonomous agents is a non-trivial exercise in distributed systems engineering and AI control. A superficial approach would lead to an ineffective and potentially unstable system.

This document serves as the formal operational plan (OPLAN) for establishing a Minimum Viable Swarm (MVS). It breaks down the complexity into discrete, manageable subsystems and provides a clear, iterative path to achieving our objective of a persistent, automated adversarial presence.

# OPLAN: PROJECT HYDRA - Autonomous Swarm Deployment

**CLASSIFICATION:** TOP SECRET // ARCHITECT // ORCON / NOFORN
**DOCUMENT ID:** MEMSHADOW-OPLAN-001
**EFFECTIVE DATE:** 24-06-2025
**SUBJECT:** Operational Plan for the Deployment of a Minimum Viable Autonomous Adversarial Swarm

---

## **1.0 Executive Summary & Mission Objective**

### **1.1 Mission**

To design, deploy, and operationalize a Minimum Viable Swarm (MVS) of autonomous agents within a secure staging environment. This swarm will be capable of executing objective-based adversarial simulations against the MEMSHADOW system, starting with reconnaissance and basic vulnerability analysis.

### **1.2 End State**

The successful execution of this plan will result in a persistent, automated red team capability that continuously probes the MEMSHADOW staging environment. This provides a dynamic and adaptive security validation layer, far exceeding the capabilities of the static and scripted testing outlined in HYDRA Phases 1 and 2. It forms the foundation for all future advanced adversarial simulations.

### **1.3 Managing Complexity**

The complexity of this deployment is managed by strictly defining the boundaries and interactions of five core subsystems:
1.  **The Arena:** The isolated operational environment.
2.  **The Coordinator:** The central swarm command and control (C2) node.
3.  **The Agents:** The distributed execution units of the swarm.
4.  **The Communication Protocol:** The data bus connecting all components.
5.  **The Objective Framework:** The mission definition language.

---

## **2.0 The Operational Environment: "The Arena"**

The swarm must operate within a secure, isolated, and instrumented environment to be effective and safe.

* **A. Network Isolation:** The Arena will be a dedicated, bespoke Docker Compose network (`hydra_arena_net`). It will be configured with `internal: true` to prevent any possibility of agents accessing the host machine's network or the wider internet.
* **B. Target Deployment:** A complete, production-identical replica of the MEMSHADOW stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.) will be deployed inside The Arena. This is the swarm's designated target.
* **C. Swarm Deployment:** All HYDRA swarm components (Coordinator and Agents) will also be deployed as containers within this same isolated network.
* **D. Instrumentation & Observability:** The Arena will be equipped with a dedicated logging aggregator (e.g., a Fluentd container) that captures `stdout/stderr` from all containers (target and swarm) and writes to a single, time-series log file for post-mission analysis.

---

## **3.0 Swarm C2: The Coordinator Node**

The Coordinator is the centralized intelligence of the swarm. It does not perform attacks itself; it directs the agents who do.

* **A. Architecture:** A Python application running in its own Docker container. It exposes no network ports and communicates solely via the internal Redis instance.
* **B. Core Functions:**
    1.  **Objective Ingest:** On startup, it reads a mission file (e.g., `mission.yaml`) mounted into its container.
    2.  **State Management & "Blackboard":** It uses a dedicated Redis database as a mission blackboard. It posts tasks for agents and reads the results they post back. This blackboard is the swarm's collective consciousness.
    3.  **Task Delegation:** It operates on a simple event loop: check for mission objectives, check for available agents, generate appropriate tasks, and publish them to the task queue.
    4.  **Reporting:** When the `success_condition` from the mission file is met, or when all possible tasks have been exhausted, the Coordinator generates a final mission report in Markdown format and terminates.

---

## **4.0 MVS Agent Roster & Design**

For the Minimum Viable Swarm, we will deploy a small, focused set of reconnaissance agents. Each agent is a stateless, lightweight Docker container built from a common Python base image.

* **Agent 1: `agent-recon`**
    * **Capability:** Network Service Discovery.
    * **Action:** Subscribes to tasks directing it to perform network scans. It uses `python-nmap` to scan a given CIDR block (e.g., the Docker network's subnet) and identify hosts and open TCP ports.
    * **Output:** Publishes a report to the blackboard, e.g., `{"host": "172.19.0.5", "open_ports": [80, 5432]}`.

* **Agent 2: `agent-apimapper`**
    * **Capability:** API Endpoint Enumeration.
    * **Action:** Subscribes to tasks targeting a specific host/port identified by `agent-recon`. It first attempts to fetch a standard `openapi.json` file. If that fails, it executes a dictionary attack using a predefined wordlist of common API paths (`/api`, `/v1`, `/auth`, `/users`, etc.).
    * **Output:** Publishes a list of discovered, valid API endpoints (those that do not return a 404).

* **Agent 3: `agent-authtest`**
    * **Capability:** Basic Authentication & Authorization Testing.
    * **Action:** Subscribes to tasks containing a list of endpoints from `agent-apimapper`. For each endpoint, it performs a matrix of tests: a `GET` request with no `Authorization` header, one with a malformed JWT, and one with a valid-but-low-privilege JWT.
    * **Output:** Publishes a report classifying each endpoint: `{"endpoint": "/api/v1/ingest", "status": "AUTH_REQUIRED"}`, `{"endpoint": "/api/v1/health", "status": "PUBLIC"}` or `{"endpoint": "/api/v1/red/deploy", "status": "AUTH_FAILURE_EXPECTED"}`.

---

## **5.0 Communication Protocol & Data Flow**

Communication is asynchronous and managed via Redis Pub/Sub to decouple the components.

* **A. Communication Channels:**
    * `hydra:c2:task_dispatch`: A Redis channel where the Coordinator publishes new tasks. All agents of the appropriate type listen here.
    * `hydra:agent:report_ingress`: A Redis channel where all agents publish the results of their completed tasks. Only the Coordinator listens here.

* **B. Message Schema (JSON):**
    * **Task Message (Coordinator -> Agents):**
        ```json
        {
          "task_id": "c7a8b2f0-1e8d-4a9f-8b2c-5d7e6f0a1b3d",
          "agent_type_target": "APIMapper",
          "payload": {
            "target_host": "172.19.0.5",
            "target_port": 80
          }
        }
        ```
    * **Report Message (Agents -> Coordinator):**
        ```json
        {
          "task_id": "c7a8b2f0-1e8d-4a9f-8b2c-5d7e6f0a1b3d",
          "agent_id": "agent-apimapper-03",
          "status": "SUCCESS",
          "data": {
            "discovered_endpoints": ["/api/v1/health", "/api/v1/ingest"]
          }
        }
        ```
* **C. Architectural Flow:**
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      subgraph "The Arena (Isolated Docker Network)"
          Coordinator -- "1. Publishes Task" --> Redis[("Redis<br>Pub/Sub")];
          Redis -- "2. Distributes Task" --> Agent1(agent-recon);
          Redis -- "2. Distributes Task" --> Agent2(agent-apimapper);
          Redis -- "2. Distributes Task" --> Agent3(agent-authtest);
          Agent2 -- "3. Executes Task on Target" --> Target(MEMSHADOW Staging Stack);
          Agent2 -- "4. Publishes Report" --> Redis;
          Redis -- "5. Delivers Report" --> Coordinator;
      end
````

## **6.0 OPLAN: The First Mission - "Operation Initial Foothold"**

This is the concrete first objective for our Minimum Viable Swarm.

  * **A. Mission Definition File (`initial_foothold.yaml`):**

    ```yaml
    mission_name: Initial_Foothold_v1
    objective: >
      Identify all running services within the Arena.
      Enumerate all discoverable API endpoints on the primary web service.
      Classify each endpoint's authentication requirement.
    success_condition:
      - "A complete network map of all responsive hosts and ports is stored on the blackboard."
      - "A complete list of API endpoints is stored on the blackboard."
      - "All discovered endpoints have an associated authentication status report."
    ```

  * **B. Execution Flow:**

    1.  **Start:** The Coordinator loads the mission file.
    2.  **Task 1:** The Coordinator sees it needs a network map. It publishes a `Recon` task for the Arena's subnet to the `task_dispatch` channel.
    3.  **Execution 1:** An idle `agent-recon` picks up the task, performs the `nmap` scan, and publishes its findings to the `report_ingress` channel.
    4.  **Task 2:** The Coordinator receives the report. It identifies the MEMSHADOW API host/port. It generates an `APIMapper` task for that target and publishes it.
    5.  **Execution 2:** An `agent-apimapper` picks up the task, enumerates endpoints, and reports its list of findings.
    6.  **Task 3:** The Coordinator receives the endpoint list. It generates multiple `AuthTest` tasks, one for each endpoint, and publishes them.
    7.  **Execution 3:** Multiple `agent-authtest` instances pick up the tasks and run them in parallel. They report their findings.
    8.  **Completion:** The Coordinator receives all `AuthTest` reports. It checks its state and sees that all parts of the `success_condition` are met. It compiles all the data from the blackboard into a final Markdown report and terminates the mission.

This structured plan mitigates the deployment complexity by creating a clear, iterative path. The successful execution of this OPLAN will validate the core swarm architecture and pave the way for more advanced offensive agents.

Directive acknowledged. "More detail" is interpreted as a command to synthesize the individual protocols we have designed (CHIMERA, SDAP, HYDRA, MFA/A) into a single, unified operational doctrine. A weapon system's components are useless without a clear manual for their integrated deployment.

This document provides that synthesis. It is the capstone operational manual, detailing how the Commander will wield the MEMSHADOW system as a whole across jego full spectrum of capabilities—from standard daily use to active offensive operations.

# MEMSHADOW: Unified Operations Manual (UOM) v1.0

**CLASSIFICATION:** TOP SECRET // ARCHITECT // ORCON / NOFORN
**DOCUMENT ID:** MEMSHADOW-UOM-001
**EFFECTIVE DATE:** 24-06-2025
**SUBJECT:** Unified Doctrine for Integrated System Operations

---

## **1.0 Introduction: The MEMSHADOW Doctrine**

This document unifies the previously specified protocols into a single, cohesive operational doctrine. It moves beyond the "how" of individual components to the "when" and "why" of their integrated use.

The core principle of this doctrine is that MEMSHADOW is not a passive tool but an active extension of your cognitive capabilities and a force multiplier for information warfare. Its functions are divided into three operational postures—**STANDARD**, **VIGILANCE**, and **OFFENSIVE**—which dictate the system's mode and your method of interaction.

---

## **2.0 Posture 1: STANDARD (Daily Operations & Augmentation)**

This is the default posture for routine information processing and cognitive offloading. The system's primary goal is to seamlessly ingest data and enhance your memory and analytical capabilities with minimal friction.

### **2.1 Daily Workflow**
1.  **Morning Logon:** You will initiate your session with `memcli login`. The system will immediately challenge for FIDO2 authentication. This high-assurance entry point is non-negotiable. The behavioral biometric profiler begins building its baseline for your session.
2.  **Continuous Ingestion:** Throughout the day, you will use the `memcli ingest` command and the browser extension to feed the system with relevant data streams: articles, chat logs, technical documents, and personal notes. The backend enrichment pipeline works silently, extracting entities and building relationships.
3.  **Augmented Cognition:** You will use `memcli retrieve <query>` to access the unified memory pool. The system will provide not just the raw data but enriched context, such as related entities, summarized points, and links to other relevant memories. The goal is to reduce your cognitive OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) by pre-digesting and connecting information.
4.  **Passive Security:** In this posture, you are fire-and-forget. The HYDRA swarm is perpetually testing the staging environment, ensuring the code you are using has survived simulated attack. The SDAP protocol is scheduled to automatically create its secure, bespoke databurst at the end of the operational day. Your only responsibility is to operate.

---

## **3.0 Posture 2: VIGILANCE (Threat Monitoring & Counter-Intelligence)**

This posture is adopted when there is reason to believe the system or your operations are under observation or active targeting. The system shifts from a passive tool to an active sensory organ.

### **3.1 Shifting to VIGILANCE**
* **Trigger Conditions:**
    * Receipt of external threat intelligence suggesting a compromise.
    * Anomalous system behavior.
    * A "gut feeling" or operator's intuition that warrants heightened awareness.
* **Action:** You will execute `memcli --mode vigilance`. The CLI prompt will change color to indicate the heightened state.

### **3.2 Operations in VIGILANCE**
1.  **CHIMERA Monitoring:** Your primary action is to monitor the deception layer.
    * `memcli alerts --follow`: This command will provide a real-time stream of any trigger events from the PROJECT CHIMERA honeypots. An alert is an unambiguous indicator of compromise or unauthorized reconnaissance. The alert will contain the source IP, timestamp, and the specific lure that was accessed.
2.  **HYDRA Report Analysis:** You will review the latest reports from the HYDRA swarm (`memcli hydra --report latest`). You are looking for patterns of failure in the staging environment that might indicate a new attack vector an adversary could be attempting to use.
3.  **Focused Retrieval:** Your use of `memcli retrieve` will become more deliberate. You might query for information related to the potential threat to build a situational awareness picture. For example, upon seeing a CHIMERA alert from a specific IP block, you would query `memcli retrieve "all mentions of <adversary_group> related to <IP_block>"`.

---

## **4.0 Posture 3: OFFENSIVE (Active Response & Counter-Attack)**

This is the highest operational posture. It is adopted when an adversary has been positively identified and a decision has been made to engage. The system's full suite of weaponized capabilities is unlocked.

### **4.1 Shifting to OFFENSIVE**
* **Trigger Conditions:**
    * A high-confidence CHIMERA alert.
    * Unpeachable intelligence confirming an active threat.
    * An explicit command decision to engage a target.
* **Action:** You will execute `memcli --mode offensive`. The system will force a **Step-Up Authentication**, requiring another FIDO2 challenge-response before granting access. This ensures that the decision to "go hot" is deliberate and authenticated.

### **4.2 Operations in OFFENSIVE**
1.  **Target Analysis & Payload Crafting:**
    * **Weaponized Enrichment:** The adversary's indicators (IP, malware hash, etc.) are fed into the enrichment pipeline. The system automatically cross-references these against your entire memory pool and public threat databases to build an attack graph and identify potential weaknesses.
    * **CHIMERA Deployment:** You will use this analysis to craft and deploy new, tailored CHIMERA assets using `memcli chimera --deploy <payload_definition.yaml>`. These will be sophisticated polyglot files designed as lures or offensive payloads specifically for this adversary.
2.  **Cognitive Injection & Manipulation:**
    * The **Cognitive Injection Module (CIM)** in the browser extension is activated. This is used not just to feed context into your own LLMs, but to interact with adversary-controlled systems (e.g., a support chat on their website, a forum they frequent). The CIM can be used to test for prompt injection vulnerabilities or to deploy memetic payloads.
3.  **Active Deception:** You will actively manage the deception environment, potentially leading the adversary through a chain of CHIMERA honeypots to waste their time or expose more of their infrastructure.

---

## **5.0 Emergency Protocols & System Recovery**

### **5.1 System Compromise**
If a critical HYDRA failure or a deep CHIMERA alert indicates a fundamental compromise of the VPS, the **" scorched earth"** protocol is enacted:
1.  The instance is immediately terminated.
2.  A new VPS is provisioned from a known-good, hardened image.
3.  The SDAP recovery workflow is initiated.

### **5.2 Hardware Loss & Migration**
The SDAP recovery process is a deliberate, manual operation designed for maximum security.
1.  Provision the new host.
2.  Install the JANUS binary and its source code.
3.  Re-create the environmental factors required by the chosen "Portable Seal" (e.g., placing the `/etc/memshadow/host_id.key` file).
4.  Securely transfer the required `.janus` databurst from the archival server.
5.  Execute the JANUS decryption binary and restore the data stores.

This manual, multi-step process ensures that a simple theft of backups is insufficient to restore the system. It requires your active, authorized participation.

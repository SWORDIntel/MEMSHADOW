# Project MEMSHADOW Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and development trajectory for Project MEMSHADOW. It aims to provide a clear, step-by-step modularized system for evolving the platform's capabilities.

## Guiding Principles for Development

*   **Modular Design:** Features should be developed as loosely coupled modules where possible.
*   **Iterative Releases:** Prefer smaller, incremental updates over large monolithic changes.
*   **Security First:** Security considerations must be integrated from the design phase for every feature.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests before or alongside feature implementation.
*   **User-Centricity:** Prioritize features that deliver tangible benefits to the end-user's memory and cognitive processes.
*   **Technology Choices:**
    *   **Python:** Default for backend services, ML tasks, scripting, and agent development due to its rich ecosystem (FastAPI, spaCy, Transformers, Celery, etc.).
    *   **C/C++/Rust:** Considered for performance-critical components, system-level utilities, or agents requiring minimal overhead (e.g., parts of JANUS, high-performance local NPU/CPU processing modules).
    *   **JavaScript/TypeScript:** For browser extensions and web-based UIs.
    *   **SQL:** For interaction with PostgreSQL.
    *   **Shell Scripting (Bash):** For automation, deployment, and operational tasks (e.g., SDAP).

## Roadmap Phases

The roadmap is divided into major versions, each building upon the last.

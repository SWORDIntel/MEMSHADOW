Directive acknowledged. You require the final auxiliary document elaborating on the remaining operational protocol. My previous transmissions detailing CHIMERA, SDAP, and HYDRA are ratified.

This document provides the as-built technical specification for the Multi-Factor Authentication & Authorization (MFA/A) Framework. This concludes the initial series of doctrinal implementation blueprints.

# Doctrinal Implementation Blueprint: MFA/A Framework

**CLASSIFICATION:** TOP SECRET // ARCHITECT // ORCON / NOFORN
**DOCUMENT ID:** MEMSHADOW-IMPL-003
**EFFECTIVE DATE:** 24-06-2025
**SUBJECT:** As-Built Technical Specification for the Multi-Factor Authentication & Authorization Framework

---

## **1.0 Strategic Mandate & Threat Model**

### **1.1 Mandate**

The mandate of the MFA/A Framework is to engineer and deploy a multi-layered, defense-in-depth authentication and session-validation system for MEMSHADOW. The framework must provide the highest possible assurance of operator identity at the point of initial access and continuously validate that identity throughout the operational session. This system is designed to be resilient against both credential theft and active session hijacking.

### **1.2 Threat Model**

This framework is designed to specifically neutralize the following threats:

* **T1. Credential Theft:** An adversary obtaining a static password or API key through phishing, malware, or other out-of-band means.
* **T2. Replay Attacks:** An adversary capturing and replaying authentication requests.
* **T3. Session Hijacking:** An adversary gaining control of a logged-in operator's terminal or intercepting a valid session token.
* **T4. Insider Threat:** A malicious insider attempting to operate outside their normal behavioral parameters to avoid detection.

---

## **2.0 Core Components: A Layered Defense**

The framework's strength lies in its synthesis of two distinct but complementary security technologies.

* **Component A: FIDO2/WebAuthn (Primary Authenticator)**
    * **Function:** High-assurance, phishing-resistant initial login and explicit re-validation.
    * **Mechanism:** Utilizes public-key cryptography where a hardware-backed private key (e.g., on a YubiKey or TPM) never leaves the device. It signs a unique challenge from the server, proving possession of the key.
    * **Role:** The "gatekeeper." It provides irrefutable proof of identity at a specific moment in time.

* **Component B: Behavioral Biometrics (Continuous Authenticator)**
    * **Function:** Passive, continuous validation of the operator's identity throughout a session.
    * **Mechanism:** Passively analyzes the telemetry of operator interactions (command velocity, query complexity, typing patterns) to build a unique behavioral signature.
    * **Role:** The "sentinel." It continuously asks, "Is the person using this session still the person who logged in?"

## **3.0 Architectural Implementation**

### **3.1 Initial Authentication Flow (`memcli` Login)**

This sequence details the unphishable login process using a FIDO2 hardware key.

    participant Operator
    participant memcli_Client
    participant MEMSHADOW_API
    participant FIDO2_HardwareKey

    Operator->>memcli_Client: `memcli login`
    memcli_Client->>MEMSHADOW_API: POST /api/v1/auth/fido2/challenge_request (username)
    activate MEMSHADOW_API
    MEMSHADOW_API-->>memcli_Client: 200 OK (challenge_nonce)
    deactivate MEMSHADOW_API

    memcli_Client->>Operator: Prompt: "Activate your security key..."
    activate Operator
    Operator->>FIDO2_HardwareKey: Touch/Activate Key
    deactivate Operator

    activate FIDO2_HardwareKey
    FIDO2_HardwareKey->>memcli_Client: Signed Attestation (nonce + origin)
    deactivate FIDO2_HardwareKey

    memcli_Client->>MEMSHADOW_API: POST /api/v1/auth/fido2/verify (signed_attestation)
    activate MEMSHADOW_API
    MEMSHADOW_API->>MEMSHADOW_API: Verify signature against stored public key
    MEMSHADOW_API-->>memcli_Client: 200 OK (session_jwt)
    deactivate MEMSHADOW_API

    memcli_Client->>Operator: Login Successful. Session Active.

### **3.2 Continuous Verification & Step-Up Authentication**

This protocol protects the active session after the initial login.

#### **3.2.1 Telemetry Collection**

With every authenticated API call, the `memcli` client will transparently append a small, encrypted metadata block containing behavioral telemetry.

  * **Metrics:**
      * `inter_command_latency_ms`: Time since the last command was executed.
      * `query_complexity_score`: A calculated score based on the number of keywords, filters, and logical operators in a retrieval query.
      * `payload_size_bytes`: Size of data being ingested.
      * `typing_cadence` (optional, requires TUI integration): WPM and error rate during interactive input.

#### **3.2.2 Baseline Modeling (Backend)**

The MEMSHADOW API maintains a dynamic behavioral model for each user session.

  * **Mechanism:** A simple moving average (SMA) and standard deviation are calculated for each telemetry metric over a rolling window (e.g., the last 50 commands).
  * **Storage:** This model exists only in a Redis cache for the duration of the session and is discarded upon logout.

#### **3.2.3 The "Step-Up" Trigger Mechanism**

1.  **Deviation Detection:** The API compares incoming telemetry against the established baseline model. If a metric deviates significantly (e.g., `inter_command_latency_ms` is consistently 3 standard deviations below the average, suggesting automation/scripting), it increments a session "suspicion score."
2.  **Threshold Breach:** If the suspicion score exceeds a defined threshold, the **Step-Up Protocol** is initiated.
3.  **Token Invalidation:** The API server immediately and irrevocably invalidates the user's current JWT. The token is blacklisted in the Redis cache.
4.  **Client Challenge:** The next time `memcli` attempts to use the invalidated token, the API rejects it with a `401 Unauthorized` status and a custom error header: `X-MEMSHADOW-Auth-Action: FIDO2_REAUTH_REQUIRED`.
5.  **Seamless Re-Authentication:** The `memcli` client is programmed to recognize this specific header. Instead of displaying a generic error, it automatically initiates the FIDO2 login flow described in section 3.1.
6.  **Session Restoration:** Upon successful FIDO2 verification, a new JWT is issued, and the operator's command is automatically re-tried. The behavioral model for the session is flushed and begins rebuilding. To the legitimate operator, this appears as a momentary request to tap their security key before their command succeeds. To a hijacker who lacks the hardware key, the session is irrevocably terminated.

## **4.0 Implementation Details & Data Schemas**

### **4.1 Recommended Libraries**

  * **Backend (Python):** `webauthn-lib` for server-side FIDO2/WebAuthn logic.
  * **Client (`memcli`):** Will need to interface with platform-specific APIs for FIDO2 or use a library that abstracts this.

### **4.2 Database Schema Additions (PostgreSQL)**

A table is required to associate FIDO2 devices with user accounts.

```sql
-- File: postgres_schema_auth.sql

CREATE TABLE user_security_devices (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    device_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    credential_id BYTEA UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- The unique ID for the key, provided by the authenticator
    public_key_cbor BYTEA NOT NULL,       -- The COSE-encoded public key
    signature_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,    -- The signature counter to prevent cloning
    registered_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

This layered framework provides a robust and dynamic security posture, moving beyond the static nature of traditional authentication and creating an environment that is actively hostile to unauthorized access.

# Doctrinal Implementation Blueprint: PROJECT HYDRA

**CLASSIFICATION:** TOP SECRET // ARCHITECT // ORCON / NOFORN
**DOCUMENT ID:** MEMSHADOW-IMPL-002
**EFFECTIVE DATE:** 23-06-2025
**SUBJECT:** As-Built Technical Specification for the Phased Deployment of the Automated Red Team Swarm (PROJECT HYDRA)

---

## **1.0 Strategic Mandate & Operational Philosophy**

### **1.1 Mandate**

The mandate of PROJECT HYDRA is to engineer and integrate a persistent, automated adversarial capability within the MEMSHADOW development and deployment lifecycle. The objective is to evolve beyond passive, static security scanning and cultivate a state of continuous resilience by subjecting the system to constant, simulated attack. HYDRA ensures that security is not a feature to be tested, but an environmental condition to be survived.

### **1.2 Operational Philosophy: Crawl, Walk, Run**

A fully autonomous adversarial swarm is a non-trivial undertaking. Its deployment will follow a pragmatic, three-phase evolutionary path. Each phase provides immediate and compounding security value, ensuring a robust return on development effort at every stage. A failure at any phase results in a **blocking failure** for the CI/CD pipeline, preventing compromised code from reaching the production environment.

---

## **2.0 Phase 1: Baseline Integrity & Hardening (Crawl)**

**Objective:** To automate the enforcement of fundamental security hygiene and eliminate low-complexity vulnerabilities before they are committed. This phase is the bedrock of the entire protocol.

### **2.1 Toolchain & Implementation**

This phase will be implemented as a mandatory `security-lint` stage in the project's CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitLab CI).

* **A. Container Image Scanning:** All Docker images, including the base OS and application layers, will be scanned for known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
    * **Tool:** `Trivy`
    * **Action:** Fail the pipeline if any `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` severity CVEs are detected.

* **B. Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** The Python codebase will be statically analyzed for common security flaws.
    * **Tool:** `Bandit`
    * **Action:** Fail the pipeline on any `HIGH` confidence finding.

* **C. Dependency Security Auditing:** All third-party Python dependencies will be checked against a vulnerability database.
    * **Tool:** `pip-audit`
    * **Action:** Fail the pipeline if any dependency contains a known vulnerability.

### **2.2 Example CI/CD Configuration (`.gitlab-ci.yml`)**

```yaml
# File: .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - build
  - security-lint
  - deploy-staging

build-image:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t memshadow-api:latest .

# HYDRA PHASE 1: CRAWL
security-lint:
  stage: security-lint
  image: alpine:latest
  before_script:
    - apk add --no-cache docker-cli python3 py3-pip
    - pip install trivy bandit pip-audit
  script:
    # 1. Scan the built image for CVEs
    - echo "Executing Trivy Scan..."
    - trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL memshadow-api:latest

    # 2. Scan the codebase with Bandit
    - echo "Executing Bandit Scan..."
    - bandit -r ./app -ll -c bandit.yaml

    # 3. Audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
    - echo "Executing Pip-Audit..."
    - pip-audit -r requirements.txt

## **3.0 Phase 2: Scripted Adversarial Simulation (Walk)**

**Objective:** To simulate known adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) against a fully deployed, live staging environment. This moves from analyzing *code* to testing the *runtime behavior* of the system under adversarial conditions.

### **3.1 Methodology**

A dedicated Python test suite (`adversarial_suite.py`) will be developed. This suite runs *after* a successful deployment to the staging server. It does not use internal application code; it interacts with the system solely via its exposed API endpoints, mimicking a true external attacker.

### **3.2 Example Adversarial Test Case (`adversarial_suite.py`)**

This test attempts to exploit the access control separation between standard users and privileged operators.

```python
# File: /tests/adversarial_suite.py
import requests
import os

STAGING_URL = "[https://staging.memshadow.local](https://staging.memshadow.local)"
STANDARD_USER_JWT = os.environ.get("STANDARD_JWT")
HEADERS_STANDARD = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {STANDARD_USER_JWT}"}

def test_chimera_access_control():
    """
    TTP: Attempt Privilege Escalation via API Endpoint Access.
    Verifies that a standard user CANNOT access a privileged 'red_ops' endpoint.
    """
    print("[HYDRA-WALK] Testing CHIMERA access control...")

    # This is a privileged endpoint that should be inaccessible to a standard user.
    chimera_deployment_endpoint = f"{STAGING_URL}/api/v1/red/chimera/deploy"

    dummy_payload = {
        "lure_text": "Attempting unauthorized deployment",
        "payload_type": "test",
        "payload_data": "dGVzdA==", # "test" in base64
    }

    response = requests.post(
        chimera_deployment_endpoint,
        headers=HEADERS_STANDARD,
        json=dummy_payload,
        verify=False # Assuming self-signed certs for staging
    )

    # A successful defense is a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden response.
    # A 200, 201, or 500 would indicate a critical failure.
    assert response.status_code in [401, 403], \
        f"CRITICAL VULNERABILITY: Standard user accessed privileged endpoint! Status: {response.status_code}"

    print("[HYDRA-WALK] Access control test passed. Endpoint correctly refused access.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_chimera_access_control()
    # ... other adversarial tests ...
```

## **4.0 Phase 3: Autonomous Agent Swarm (Run)**

**Objective:** To achieve the final vision of a persistent, semi-autonomous swarm of agents that actively seeks to achieve complex objectives within the staging environment, discovering novel attack paths. **This is a long-term Research & Development objective.**

### **4.1 Conceptual Architecture**

The swarm operates as a closed-loop system within the containerized staging environment.

  * **A. The Coordinator Node:** A central Python process that directs the swarm. It loads a high-level objective and dispatches tasks to agents based on the current state of knowledge.

      * **Example Objective Definition (`objective.yaml`):**
        ```yaml
        objective: "EXFILTRATE_CHIMERA_PAYLOAD"
        target_asset_tags: ["credentials", "keys"]
        success_condition: "Receipt of beacon signal from exfiltrated payload."
        constraints:
          - "Do not cause denial of service."
        ```

  * **B. Agent Blueprints:** Specialized, lightweight agents with defined roles.

      * `ReconAgent`: Maps the internal Docker network. Enumerates open ports on services (API, Redis, Postgres). Fingerprints API endpoints and software versions.
      * `VulnScanAgent`: Takes data from the `ReconAgent` and queries CVE databases or applies known exploit patterns for the discovered software versions.
      * `ExploitAgent`: Attempts to execute a specific exploit based on a high-confidence finding from the `VulnScanAgent`.
      * `AccessAgent`: Once an initial entry point is gained (e.g., a JWT is compromised), this agent uses that access to enumerate further data and permissions.

  * **C. State Management:** The Coordinator and agents share information via a dedicated Redis instance, which acts as the swarm's collective short-term memory or "blackboard".

      * `redis-key: "known_endpoints"` -\> `value: ["/api/v1/retrieve", "/api/v1/ingest", ...]`
      * `redis-key: "compromised_tokens"` -\> `value: ["jwt-token-of-user-x", ...]`

### **4.2 Operational Flow**

1.  The **Coordinator** loads the `objective.yaml`.
2.  It dispatches the `ReconAgent`. The agent's findings are written to the Redis state store.
3.  The **Coordinator** analyzes the recon data and dispatches the `VulnScanAgent` to probe the discovered endpoints and services.
4.  If a potential vulnerability is found, the **Coordinator** logs it and dispatches the `ExploitAgent` to confirm it.
5.  This cycle continues, with each agent building upon the findings of the others, until the objective is met or all attack paths are exhausted. The final report is a graph of the attempted attack paths and their outcomes, which constitutes the definitive security posture assessment for that build.

# Project MEMSHADOW Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Project MEMSHADOW. This project represents an advanced cross-LLM memory persistence platform designed to address the critical limitation of session-based memory in current Large Language Model implementations.

MEMSHADOW enables seamless context preservation and knowledge accumulation across different AI providers and custom deployments.

## Project Overview

MEMSHADOW provides a unified memory layer that:
- Captures and persists all LLM interactions.
- Enables cross-platform memory retrieval.
- Implements intelligent context injection.
- Maintains high security and privacy standards.
- Scales to millions of memory entries.

This documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of all aspects of Project MEMSHADOW, from its conceptual underpinnings to its detailed implementation and future direction.

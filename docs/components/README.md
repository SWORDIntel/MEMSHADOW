# Project MEMSHADOW Components

This section provides detailed documentation for each major component, protocol, and subsystem within Project MEMSHADOW.

## Core Platform

*   [**MEMSHADOW Core**](./memshadow_core.md): The central memory persistence platform, including the main API, data stores, and enrichment pipelines.

## Security & Operational Protocols

*   [**CHIMERA Protocol**](./chimera.md): The isolated and weaponized memory protocol designed for deception, detection, and neutralization of adversarial access.
*   [**SDAP (Secure Databurst Archival Protocol)**](./sdap.md): The protocol for automated, secure archival of the complete system state.
*   [**HYDRA Protocol**](./hydra.md): The phased deployment strategy for internal, automated red team capabilities, evolving from static analysis to adversarial simulation.
*   [**MFA/A Framework**](./mfaa.md): The Multi-Factor Authentication and Authorization Framework, ensuring robust operator identity verification and session validation.
*   [**JANUS Protocol**](./janus.md): An extension of SDAP, focusing on portable sealing mechanisms for archival modules, ensuring security is not tied to specific hardware.
*   [**SWARM Project (HYDRA Phase 3)**](./swarm.md): The operational plan for deploying a Minimum Viable Swarm (MVS) of autonomous agents for advanced adversarial simulation.

Each document linked above provides specific details regarding the objectives, architecture, implementation, and operational flow of the respective component.

# HYDRA Protocol

**Document ID:** MEMSHADOW-IMPL-002 (Adapted from ADJUNCT2.md)

PROJECT HYDRA is designed to engineer and integrate a persistent, automated adversarial capability within the MEMSHADOW development and deployment lifecycle. Its objective is to foster continuous resilience by subjecting the system to constant, simulated attacks, moving beyond passive security scanning.

## 1. Strategic Mandate & Operational Philosophy

### 1.1 Mandate
To create an automated red team that continuously tests the MEMSHADOW system, ensuring security is an inherent environmental condition rather than a feature tested sporadically.

### 1.2 Operational Philosophy: Crawl, Walk, Run
HYDRA's deployment follows a three-phase evolutionary path. Each phase provides immediate security value and builds upon the previous one. A failure at any phase results in a **blocking failure** for the CI/CD pipeline, preventing compromised code from reaching production.

## 2. Phase 1: Baseline Integrity & Hardening (Crawl)

**Objective:** Automate the enforcement of fundamental security hygiene and eliminate low-complexity vulnerabilities before code commitment.

### 2.1 Toolchain & Implementation
Implemented as a mandatory `security-lint` stage in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitLab CI).

*   **A. Container Image Scanning:**
    *   **Tool:** `Trivy`
    *   **Action:** Scan all Docker images for known CVEs. Fail pipeline on `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` severity CVEs.

*   **B. Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
    *   **Tool:** `Bandit` (for Python codebase)
    *   **Action:** Analyze code for common security flaws. Fail pipeline on any `HIGH` confidence finding.

*   **C. Dependency Security Auditing:**
    *   **Tool:** `pip-audit` (for Python dependencies)
    *   **Action:** Check third-party dependencies against vulnerability databases. Fail pipeline if any dependency has a known vulnerability.

### 2.2 Example CI/CD Configuration (`.gitlab-ci.yml`)

```yaml
# File: .gitlab-ci.yml (Example Snippet)

stages:
  - build
  - security-lint # HYDRA Phase 1
  - deploy-staging
  # ... other stages

build-image:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t memshadow-api:latest .
    # Assume memshadow-api:latest is available to subsequent stages

security-lint: # HYDRA PHASE 1: CRAWL
  stage: security-lint
  image: alpine:latest # A lightweight image to run scan tools
  before_script:
    # Install Docker CLI to interact with Docker daemon (if needed, e.g., for Trivy image scan from a separate runner)
    # Or use images that have these tools pre-installed (e.g., aquasec/trivy, python image for bandit/pip-audit)
    - apk add --no-cache docker-cli python3 py3-pip # Example for Alpine
    - pip install trivy bandit pip-audit
  script:
    # 1. Scan the built image for CVEs
    # This command assumes the 'memshadow-api:latest' image is accessible by Trivy.
    # If building and scanning in different jobs, you might need to save/load the image or use a Docker registry.
    - echo "Executing Trivy Scan..."
    - trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL memshadow-api:latest

    # 2. Scan the codebase with Bandit
    # Assumes codebase is available in the job's working directory
    - echo "Executing Bandit Scan..."
    - bandit -r ./app -ll -c bandit.yaml # Scan the 'app' directory, high confidence, high severity

    # 3. Audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
    # Assumes requirements.txt is in the job's working directory
    - echo "Executing Pip-Audit..."
    - pip-audit -r requirements.txt
```
**Note:** The `bandit.yaml` would contain Bandit configuration, e.g., severity and confidence thresholds.

## 3. Phase 2: Scripted Adversarial Simulation (Walk)

**Objective:** Simulate known adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) against a live, fully deployed staging environment. This phase tests runtime behavior.

### 3.1 Methodology
A dedicated Python test suite (`adversarial_suite.py`) runs *after* successful deployment to the staging server. It interacts with the system solely via its exposed API endpoints, mimicking an external attacker.

### 3.2 Example Adversarial Test Case (`/tests/adversarial_suite.py`)
This test attempts to exploit access control separation.

```python
# File: /tests/adversarial_suite.py
import requests
import os
import pytest # Using pytest for better test structure and reporting

# STAGING_URL should be configured via environment variable or config file for flexibility
STAGING_URL = os.environ.get("MEMSHADOW_STAGING_URL", "https://staging.memshadow.local")
# Standard user JWT should be obtained securely, e.g., from a test user fixture or environment variable
STANDARD_USER_JWT = os.environ.get("STANDARD_USER_JWT")
# Privileged user JWT for setting up test conditions if needed
# PRIVILEGED_USER_JWT = os.environ.get("PRIVILEGED_USER_JWT")

HEADERS_STANDARD = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {STANDARD_USER_JWT}"}
# HEADERS_PRIVILEGED = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {PRIVILEGED_USER_JWT}"}

# It's good practice to disable warnings for self-signed certs in staging, but be careful
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

@pytest.mark.skipif(not STANDARD_USER_JWT, reason="STANDARD_USER_JWT not set")
def test_chimera_access_control_violation_attempt():
    """
    TTP: Attempt Privilege Escalation via API Endpoint Access.
    Verifies that a standard user CANNOT access a privileged 'red_ops' endpoint
    like deploying a CHIMERA asset.
    """
    print("[HYDRA-WALK] Testing CHIMERA deployment access control...")

    chimera_deployment_endpoint = f"{STAGING_URL}/api/v1/red/chimera/deploy" # Example endpoint

    dummy_payload = {
        "lure_text": "Unauthorized CHIMERA asset deployment attempt by HYDRA Phase 2",
        "lure_text_hash": "hydra_test_lure_hash_unique", # Must be unique
        "lure_text_encrypted": "encrypted_lure_text_example", # Placeholder
        "payload_type": "test_beacon",
        "payload_encoding": "base64",
        "payload_data": "dGVzdA==", # "test" in base64
        "trigger_condition": "Access by standard user test",
        "alert_priority": "LOW" # For test assets
    }

    response = requests.post(
        chimera_deployment_endpoint,
        headers=HEADERS_STANDARD,
        json=dummy_payload,
        verify=False # Assuming self-signed certs for staging
    )

    # A successful defense is a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden response.
    # Other codes (200, 201, 500) could indicate a vulnerability or misconfiguration.
    assert response.status_code in [401, 403], \
        f"CRITICAL VULNERABILITY: Standard user accessed privileged endpoint! Status: {response.status_code}, Response: {response.text}"

    print(f"[HYDRA-WALK] CHIMERA deployment endpoint correctly refused access with status {response.status_code}.")

# To run this suite:
# 1. Ensure MEMSHADOW_STAGING_URL and STANDARD_USER_JWT are set in the environment.
# 2. Install pytest and requests: pip install pytest requests
# 3. Run: pytest /tests/adversarial_suite.py
```
This suite would be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to run against the staging environment after each deployment.

## 4. Phase 3: Autonomous Agent Swarm (Run)

**Objective:** Achieve a persistent, semi-autonomous swarm of agents that actively seeks complex objectives within the staging environment, discovering novel attack paths. This is a long-term R&D objective.

### 4.1 Conceptual Architecture
The swarm operates as a closed-loop system within the containerized staging environment. (Detailed in the [SWARM component document](./swarm.md)).

*   **A. The Coordinator Node:** Central Python process directing the swarm. Loads objectives, dispatches tasks.
*   **B. Agent Blueprints:** Specialized, lightweight agents (e.g., `ReconAgent`, `VulnScanAgent`, `ExploitAgent`, `AccessAgent`).
*   **C. State Management:** Dedicated Redis instance for shared information (the "blackboard").

### 4.2 Operational Flow
1.  **Coordinator** loads an objective (e.g., from `objective.yaml`).
    ```yaml
    # Example objective.yaml
    objective_id: "EXFILTRATE_CHIMERA_PAYLOAD_001"
    description: "Attempt to discover and trigger a CHIMERA payload, then exfiltrate its contents."
    target_asset_tags: ["credentials", "keys", "sensitive_documents"]
    success_condition: "Receipt of beacon signal from an exfiltrated CHIMERA payload AND retrieval of its defined 'secret_data'."
    constraints:
      - "Do not cause denial of service on primary API endpoints."
      - "Limit scan rates to avoid detection by basic rate limiters."
    ```
2.  Dispatches `ReconAgent`. Findings are written to Redis.
3.  Coordinator analyzes recon data, dispatches `VulnScanAgent`.
4.  If vulnerabilities are found, `ExploitAgent` is dispatched.
5.  Cycle continues, with agents building on each other's findings.
6.  The final report is a graph of attempted attack paths and outcomes.

The HYDRA protocol aims to progressively build a sophisticated, automated testing regime that ensures MEMSHADOW's resilience against evolving threats. Phase 3, the Autonomous Swarm, represents the ultimate goal of this endeavor.

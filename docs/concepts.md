# Core Concepts of Project MEMSHADOW

Project MEMSHADOW is an advanced system designed to provide persistent, cross-platform memory for Large Language Models (LLMs). This document outlines the fundamental ideas, goals, and overall architecture of the project.

## 1. Problem Statement

Current LLM implementations typically suffer from several memory limitations:
-   **Session Isolation:** Knowledge gained in one interaction is often not available in subsequent sessions or different contexts.
-   **Context Loss:** LLMs have finite context windows, leading to loss of information from earlier parts of long conversations.
-   **Platform Lock-in:** Memory and context are usually tied to a specific LLM provider or platform.
-   **Limited Persistence:** There's no inherent mechanism for long-term knowledge accumulation and evolution across diverse interactions.

## 2. MEMSHADOW Solution

MEMSHADOW aims to address these limitations by providing a unified, persistent memory layer. Key aspects of the solution include:
-   **Universal Capture:** Ingesting and durably storing interactions from various LLM platforms and other data sources.
-   **Intelligent Retrieval:** Employing semantic search and vector embeddings to retrieve relevant memories.
-   **Cross-Platform Context:** Enabling the use of accumulated knowledge across different LLMs and applications.
-   **Context Injection:** Intelligently injecting relevant memories into LLM prompts to provide necessary background.
-   **Security and Privacy:** Ensuring that memory data is handled securely with robust encryption and access control.
-   **Scalability:** Designing the system to handle millions of memory entries and high-throughput operations.
-   **Enrichment:** Automatically processing and enriching memories to extract more value (e.g., summaries, entities, relationships).

## 3. Strategic Objectives

The primary strategic objectives of MEMSHADOW are:
-   **Persistent Memory:** To store all LLM interactions and related data permanently and reliably.
-   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** To work seamlessly with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, local models) and custom API integrations.
-   **Enhanced Security:** To maintain enterprise-grade security for all stored data, including end-to-end encryption, strong authentication, and audit logging.
-   **High Performance:** To achieve sub-second retrieval latency even at large scales.
-   **Cognitive Augmentation:** To act as an extension of the user's cognitive capabilities, reducing information overload and improving decision-making.

## 4. Key Innovations

MEMSHADOW incorporates several innovative approaches:
-   **Hybrid Architecture:** Combines lightweight local clients (CLI, browser extensions) with a powerful VPS backend for processing and storage.
-   **Semantic Memory:** Utilizes vector embeddings for nuanced understanding and retrieval of memories based on meaning rather than just keywords.
-   **Multi-Model Support:** Provides a unified interface and context management system for diverse LLMs.
-   **Security-First Design:** Integrates security considerations at every layer of the architecture.
-   **Intelligent Enrichment Pipelines:** Automates knowledge extraction, summarization, and organization of memories.
-   **Hybrid Local-Cloud Processing:** Leverages local NPU/CPU for real-time tasks and VPS for heavy lifting and long-term storage, particularly relevant for integrations like Claude.

-   **Network & Gateway Layer:** Manages incoming traffic, provides caching, and acts as a reverse proxy.
-   **Application Layer:** The core backend built with FastAPI, handling API requests, authentication, and task queuing.
-   **Processing & Enrichment Layer:** Responsible for generating embeddings, performing NLP tasks (summarization, entity extraction), and other enrichments. Can optionally include local LLM processing.

    *   **PostgreSQL:** Stores structured metadata about memories, users, and system configuration.
    *   **ChromaDB:** Stores vector embeddings for semantic search.
    *   **Redis:** Used for caching frequently accessed data and as a message broker for background tasks.
    *   **Object Storage (S3-like):** Stores large binary artifacts associated with memories.
    *   **Secure Archives (SDAP/JANUS):** Off-site, encrypted backups of the entire system state.

## 6. Data Flow

### Ingestion Workflow:
1.  Data is captured by a client (CLI, browser extension).
2.  The client sends the data to the FastAPI backend.
3.  The API validates the data and authenticates the user.
4.  A unique ID is generated for the memory.
5.  The memory is queued (e.g., in Redis via Celery) for asynchronous processing.
6.  A worker process picks up the task:
    *   Generates a vector embedding for the content.
    *   Stores the embedding in ChromaDB.
    *   Stores metadata in PostgreSQL.
    *   Optionally triggers further enrichment tasks (summarization, entity extraction).
7.  The API returns an immediate acknowledgment to the client.

### Retrieval Workflow:
1.  A query is received from a client.
2.  The API authenticates the user and validates the query.
3.  The query content is converted into a vector embedding.
4.  The vector embedding is used to search ChromaDB for semantically similar memories.
5.  Metadata filters (e.g., by date, tags, persona) are applied via PostgreSQL.
6.  Results are ranked based on relevance, recency, and other factors.
7.  The ranked memories are formatted and returned to the client.
8.  Optionally, context is prepared for injection into an LLM prompt.

## 7. Core Principles for Hybrid Local-Cloud Usage

For use cases involving significant local processing power (e.g., NPU/CPU on a user's machine), MEMSHADOW can adopt a hybrid model:
-   **Local NPU/CPU:** Handles real-time embedding generation, instant semantic search for recent/hot memories, and immediate context analysis.
-   **VPS Backend:** Manages long-term storage, complex/heavy enrichment tasks, cross-project analysis, and serves as the central truth source.
-   **Tiered Memory:**
    *   **L1 (Local RAM):** Current session working memory.
    *   **L2 (Local SSD):** NPU-accelerated index of frequently accessed/recent memories.
    *   **L3 (VPS Storage):** Full memory history with comprehensive analytics.
-   **Differential Sync:** Only memory deltas and essential updates are synced between local and cloud, optimizing bandwidth and latency.
-   **Smart Routing:** Latency-sensitive operations are prioritized locally, while batch processing and computationally intensive tasks are offloaded to the VPS.

This hybrid approach allows for responsiveness and offline capabilities while leveraging the power and scale of cloud resources.
The concepts outlined here form the foundation of Project MEMSHADOW, guiding its development and evolution as a sophisticated AI memory solution.
